title: The power of voice

Last week I had to experience two minutes of public speaking – by giving a quick presentation for the project.

I got a lot of very helpful feedback. One of the feedback points was about my voice: it was way too quiet.

My voice was always quiet. Actually, not always… Up until age 5 it was very loud. All preschool assemblies put me in the front spot for my loud speaking. Then something happened. All of a sudden, my voice became quiet, and I became very shy. My mom couldn’t explain it.

While I was cruising internet searching for tips to improve my voice for the next presentation (because I value the feedback), I came across an explanation.

One site under nbcnews.com mentioned a scientific study that found a correlation between past experiences, particularly from our childhoods, and the way we speak today. Turns out, our past experiences play a significant role in whether or not we feel shy, and whether or not we are introverted or extroverted.  That’s is when I got it. When I was 5 my parents got divorced. Maybe that's when I became an introvert?

There is nothing wrong of being an introvert or an extravert. I guess extraverts enjoy public speaking a bit more.

For all of us (especially for introverts), I googled for a list of some popular tips for your next public speaking day:

1.	Rehearse before your presentation (listed as #1 tip on every site).

2.	Speak loudly enough so everyone could hear you (seems obvious, but still we do it).

3.	Change the volume when changing ideas. Lower volume for an aside, raise it gradually as you build toward a point.

4.	Don’t speak in a monotone. Your pitch, volume, rhythm, and timbre should fluctuate.

5.	Slow down, speak more slowly.  (Attention those who's native language is more rapid than English)

6.	Exercise. (This is not about gym.Your voice like a muscle will become stronger with exercise).

7.	Record your voice, then listen to it.

8.	Pause between points, or to emphasize major point.

9.	Practice giving speech to another person, or to your dog or cat (don’t expect much of feedback from them though).

10.	Keep your sentences short. Repeat key points.

11.	Breathe calmly.


There is always tons of skills you can improve! Start now.
